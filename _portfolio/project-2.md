Our project aims to build a rudimentary action detection system for patients and doctors. To achieve this, firstly we used IMU and sEMG sensors to gain the data from the human body, then transferred raw data to mobile phone via Bluetooth and realized visualization on it. (You can see the screenshots from the mobile phone on the slices.) After that, the mobile phone transferred the data to the cloud sever and do some data processing. We applied some neural network algorithms to identify some actions and features, and through this processing, it can generate reports contains gait or other analysis. Thus, doctors can download the reports remotely to make some diagnosis or give some treatments.
